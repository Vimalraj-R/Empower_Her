Women’s Safety and Emergency Response System – Project Explanation
This project focuses on enhancing the safety of women using technology-driven solutions. It provides an emergency response system that allows users to quickly alert trusted contacts and law enforcement in distress situations.

The system integrates real-time location tracking, AI-powered distress detection, and emergency communication tools to ensure rapid assistance. Users can activate the system with a one-touch SOS button, voice command, or hand gesture, making it accessible in urgent situations.

A Safe Route Mapping feature helps users navigate safer paths based on real-time crime data and AI predictions. The app also includes a Fake Call Feature, allowing users to simulate incoming calls to escape potentially dangerous situations.

In case of an emergency, the system will:

Send an immediate SOS alert to pre-registered contacts and authorities.

Share the live location with emergency responders.

Automatically record and upload audio/video evidence to the cloud.

Enable community-based assistance, connecting users with verified volunteers nearby.

By leveraging AI, GPS tracking, and cloud-based storage, this project aims to improve response times, empower women with safety tools, and assist law enforcement in handling distress situations effectively.
